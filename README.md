# 100 Networking and Cybersecurity Projects

Welcome to my repository for 100 projects in networking and cybersecurity! This repository contains projects ranging from basic networking applications to advanced security tools and exploits, developed in C, C++, and Rust.

## 🌐 Project Levels and Descriptions

The projects are organized into five levels based on complexity and skill focus:

- **Level 1 - Basic**: Foundational projects in networking, chat servers, ciphers, and command execution.
- **Level 2 - Essential**: Port scanners, brute-forcers, and basic web interaction tools.
- **Level 3 - Advanced Network Attacks**: Botnet creation, ARP poisoning, ransomware development, and phishing.
- **Level 4 - Data Analysis, Payloads, and Networking**: Packet analysis, hexdump, firewall development, subdomain enumeration, and IP tracking.
- **Level 5 - Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, and Post Exploitation**: Exploits, reverse engineering, cryptographic payloads, and metasploit modules.

Each project will include documentation, code, and examples where applicable.
